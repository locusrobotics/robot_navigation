    Within the individual messages, there is also the capability for highlighting/selecting a
    subset of the trajectories.

    The panel is composed of four sub-widgets. When a message is selected through the message_viewed method,
    this class sets the data for all the sub-widgets and highlights the best trajectory.

    Users can select additional trajectories through two of the widgets and update the trajectory subset
    with the setSelected method. Each of those trajectories is mapped to a different color. This class
    manages that mapping too.
