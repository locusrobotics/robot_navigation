/**
 * @brief Custom Constructor for creating a shared pointer to an existing object that doesn't delete the ptr when done
 *
 * @note This is considered bad form, and is only done here for backwards compatibility purposes. The nav_core2
 *       interfaces require shared pointers, but the creation of the shared pointer from a raw pointer takes ownership
 *       of the object such that when the object containing the shared pointer is freed, the object pointed at by the
 *       shared pointer is also freed. This presents a problem, for instance, when switching from one planner to another
 *       if the costmap is freed by one planner.
 *
 * @param raw_ptr The raw pointer to an object
 * @return A Shared pointer pointing at the raw_ptr, but when it is freed, the raw_ptr remains valid
